# From Companies to Web Companies

In the digital age, the traditional concept of a company is being challenged by the global reach of the internet. This is particularly evident for entrepreneurs who create businesses that operate entirely online, selling products or services worldwide. These digital nomads face a peculiar conundrum: they must choose a country to establish a bank account for their business, even if they have no substantial connection to that nation.

A company, in legal terms, is an entity formed and recognized by law as separate from its owners. It has rights and liabilities distinct from those of the individuals involved. Traditionally, companies are registered in specific jurisdictions, subject to local laws and regulations, and often tied to physical locations.

However, this model is increasingly at odds with the reality of internet-based businesses. These enterprises can operate from anywhere, serve customers globally, and employ a distributed workforce. The arbitrary choice of a country for banking purposes highlights the disconnect between traditional corporate structures and the borderless nature of online commerce.

This situation calls for a reimagining of the company conceptâ€”one that is as ubiquitous and borderless as the internet itself. Such a new model would need to accommodate the fluid, global nature of online businesses while still providing necessary legal and financial frameworks.

Blockchain technology could potentially enable this innovation. By leveraging its decentralized, transparent, and secure nature, a new form of "internet-native" company could emerge. This entity could exist purely on the blockchain, with smart contracts governing its operations, stakeholder relationships, and financial transactions. This would eliminate the need for a physical headquarters or traditional banking relationships tied to specific countries.

In conclusion, as the digital economy continues to evolve, so too must our concept of what constitutes a company. The creation of a truly global, internet-native corporate structure could better serve the needs of online entrepreneurs and reflect the borderless nature of their businesses.
